## Introduction
Ionic2 project for iOS/Android. 

## Purpose
Incident notification handler for the local bus service of the Esparreguera's village.

## Installation
[Ionic2](https://ionicframework.com/docs/) enviroment required.

App connects to a MySql database using API REST to insert data from user forms inside the App. 
We use [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) to write our API. (we provide apiSample.php to help this setup.)
When API REST is setting up on the server, just need to pass the correct URL in this file:
hispanoFail/hispanoFail/src/pages/services/service.ts
